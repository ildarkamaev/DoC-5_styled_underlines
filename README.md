# Days of Code #5 Styled underlines

And so it happened. I skipped almost a month since my last entry. But I have semi-decent reasons why I skipped them. One of them was that I was working on project which turned out to be a bit too challanging, although it seemed easy at first.
Still have'nt found a solution to it. So I decided to do something easier for a change. I stumbled upon Mozilla dev video about underline styling, which turned out quite interesting and so
I applied the tips they showed in the video to my own web-page and suprisingly I was pleased with the result. Nothing fancy. More like a proof-of-concept, if you will.

## WTF is this?
Following [Mozilla Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZS-7RX_c7g) video I build a web page styled underlines.

## What was used?
- Pug.js and SCSS

## What I learned
- About the existance and use of Laxxx.js

## What I didn't understand
- Everything made sense

## How can it be improved
- Could be applied to a bigger site
